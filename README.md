# LakeML: A Multi-Agent Emergent System for Collaborative Intelligence

## Overview

LakeML is a research and prototype project that aims to capture the dynamic interplay of ideas among multiple AI agents. Inspired by the metaphor of a "Lake of Possibility," LakeML envisions a computational environment where simple, specialized agents interact over a shared context—much like ripples on a lake’s surface. Through their interactions, these agents collaboratively generate, verify, and refine hypotheses until emergent, collectively endorsed solutions arise.

## Big-Picture Vision

Traditional AI systems are often built as isolated monoliths with little cross-communication. In contrast, LakeML seeks to create a system where:
- **Emergent Behavior:** Local interactions among agents (e.g., generating, verifying, and synthesizing proposals) lead to global, emergent solutions.
- **Collaborative Intelligence:** By sharing context and feedback, agents “converse” and collectively build knowledge—mirroring human collaborative decision-making.
- **Dynamic Contextualization:** Like droplets creating ripples on a lake, every agent’s input modifies the shared state, leading to continuous refinement and self-correction.

LakeML draws from theories in swarm intelligence, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and collaborative intelligence. Our goal is to build a platform that not only solves problems but does so by simulating a dynamic dialogue among diverse, purpose-driven agents.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of LakeML include:
- **Emergent Decision Making:** Enable agents to collaboratively converge on refined solutions through iterative interactions.
- **Adaptive Learning:** Incorporate reinforcement learning and rule-based logic so agents can adjust their behavior based on feedback.
- **Scalable Collaboration:** Develop a robust and extensible shared context and communication protocol that can eventually support many agents and complex tasks.
- **Bridging Theory and Practice:** Provide a research platform to explore and demonstrate how emergent behaviors can be harnessed for collaborative AI.

## Architecture and Components

LakeML is built around several core components:
- **Agent Modules:**  
  - *Generator Agents* produce initial hypotheses (proposals).  
  - *Verifier Agents* assess these proposals and provide feedback (verification or rejection).  
  - *Synthesizer Agents* combine existing proposals into meta-hypotheses.  
  - *RL-Enhanced Generator Agents* utilize Q-learning to refine proposal strategies over time.
- **Shared Context:**  
  A central "blackboard" (initially a Python dictionary) that aggregates all messages exchanged between agents.
- **Communication Protocol:**  
  Structured JSON-like messages carry information such as message type, content, priority, and references to related messages.
- **Iteration Controller:**  
  An asynchronous loop (using Python’s `asyncio`) that drives the system in discrete time steps, enabling iterative feedback and emergent dynamics.
- **Metrics Collector:**  
  Tools to monitor key performance indicators (e.g., proposal counts, verification rates) and help visualize the system’s behavior over time.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:





- **README.md:** Project overview and setup instructions.
- **requirements.txt:** (Currently empty, as we use only Python standard libraries; add packages as needed.)
- **main.py:** Entry point for running the asynchronous simulation loop.
- **agents.py:** Contains definitions for all agent types (basic Generator, Verifier, Synthesizer, and RL-enhanced Generator).
- **metrics.py:** Implements a metrics collector for tracking system performance.
